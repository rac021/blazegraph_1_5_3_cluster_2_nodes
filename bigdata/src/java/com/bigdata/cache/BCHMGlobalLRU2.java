/**
 * A mostly non-blocking cache based on a {@link ConcurrentHashMap} and batched
 * updates to its access policy. This approach encapsulates:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * (a) an unmodified ConcurrentHashMap (CHM); combined with</li>
 * <li>
 * (b) non-thread-safe thread-local buffers (TLB) for touches, managed by an
 * inner CHM<ThreadId,TLB> instance. The reason for this inner map is to allow
 * the TLB instances to be discarded by clear(); The TLBs get batched onto;</li>
 * <li>
 * (c) a shared non-thread safe access policy (LIRS, LRU) built on double-linked
 * nodes (DLN) stored in the inner CHM. Updates are deferred until holding the
 * lock (d). The DLN reference to the cached value is final. The (prior, next,
 * delete) fields are only read or written while holding the lock (d). Other
 * fields could be defined by subclassing a newDLN() method to support LIRS,
 * etc. The access policy will need [head, tail] or similar fields, which would
 * also be guarded by the lock (d);</li>
 * <li>
 * (d) a single lock guarding mutation on the access policy. Since there is only
 * one lock, there can be no lock ordering problems. Both batching touches onto
 * (c) and eviction (per the access policy) require access to the lock, but that
 * is the only lock. If the access policy batches evictions, then lock requests
 * will be rare and the whole cache will be non-blocking, wait free, and not
 * spinning on CAS locks 99% of the time; and</li>
 * <li>
 * (e) explicit management of the threads used to access the cache. e.g., by
 * queuing accepted requests and servicing them out of a thread pool, which has
 * the benefit of managing the workload imposed by the clients.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This should have the best possible performance and the simplest
 * implementation. (b) The TLB could be a DLN[] or other simple data structure.
 * The access policy (c) is composed from linking DLN instances together while
 * holding the lock.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * A get() on the outer class looks up the DLN on the inner CHM and places it
 * into the TLB (if found).</li>
 * <li>
 * A put() or putIfAbsent() on the outer class creates a new DLN and either
 * unconditionally or conditionally puts it into the inner CHM. The new DLN is
 * added to the TLB IFF it was added to the inner CHM. The access order is NOT
 * updated at this time.</li>
 * <li>
 * A remove() on the outer class acquires the lock (d), looks up the DLN in the
 * cache, and synchronously unlinks the DLN if found and sets its [deleted]
 * flag. I would recommend that the clients do not call remove() directly, or
 * that an outer remove() method exists which only removes the DLN from the
 * inner CHM and queues up remove requests to be processed the next time any
 * thread batches its touches through the lock. The inner remove() method would
 * synchronously update the DLNs.</li>
 * <li>
 * A clear() clear the ConcurrentHashMap<Key,DLN<Val>> map. It would also clear
 * the inner ConcurrentHashMap<ThreadId,TLB> map, which would cause the existing
 * TLB instances to be discarded. It would have to obtain the lock in order to
 * clear the [head,tail] or related fields for the access policy.</li>
 * </ul>
 * When batching touches through the lock, only the access order is updated by
 * the appropriate updates of the DLN nodes. If the [deleted] flag is set, then
 * the DLN has been removed from the cache and its access order is NOT updated.
 * If the cache is over its defined maximums, then evictions are batched while
 * holding the lock. Evictions are only processed when batching touches through
 * the lock.
 * <h2>Concurrency Level</h2>
 * This class supports either true thread-local buffers (concurrencyLevel := 0)
 * or striped locks protecting a pool of buffers as a configuration option (any
 * positive value for concurrencyLevel).
 * <p>
 * True thread-local buffers have significantly higher throughput since no locks
 * are required to buffer touches. However, unless the application drives all
 * threads, "touches" may linger on some thread-local buffers causing (a) the
 * access policy to not update for those objects in a timely manner (this is
 * acceptable since the objects are by definition rarely used if touches on a
 * rarely used buffer would cause a significant update in the access order); and
 * (b) the referenced objects may have their life cycle falsely extended since
 * hard references will remain on the thread-local buffer. In a pathological
 * case where the application never reuses a thread, this can cause a memory
 * leak. However, if the application reasonably managers its touches from a
 * thread pool this can have 50% better throughput over the striped lock version
 * of this class.
 * <p>
 * When the concurrencyLevel is positive, a pool of buffers will be allocated
 * and protected by striped locks. Since there are many such buffers, there is
 * less contention for each one. Since each buffer is guarded by a lock (when
 * the conurrencyLevel is GT zero), each TLB is still thread-safe without
 * further synchronization. When this option is used, the choice of the buffer
 * is made based on the hash code of the {@link Thread#getId() thread id}. While
 * this option has significantly better throughput than any other
 * {@link IGlobalLRU} implementation, its throughput is still quite a bit less
 * than when using true thread local buffers (concurrencyLevel := 0).
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link #deleteCache(UUID)} and {@link #discardAllCaches()} DO NOT
 * guarantee consistency if there are concurrent operations against the cache.
 * They have been written somewhat defensively as have {@link TLB#clear()} and
 * {@link TLB#batchUpdates(int, Object[])} in order to handle concurrent invocations
 * safely.
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation was derived from
 * {@link HardReferenceGlobalLRURecyclerExplicitDeleteRequired}. However, this
 * implementation DOES NOT permit recycling of the DLNs in order to have a
 * better guarantee of thread-safety.
 * 
 * @todo Support tx isolation. This will involve a per-tx cache I believe, so
 *       maybe the tx gets a {@link UUID}? We can then delete that cache if the
 *       tx aborts().

    /**
     * LIRS implementation. The caller MUST be holding the shared lock when
     * updating the access policy.
     * <p>
     * LIRS is an access policy with nearly the simplicity and throughput of LRU
     * which is designed to overcome many of the shortcomings of an LRU policy
     * (notably an LRU policy will evict frequently used blocks during a scan).
     * LIRS tracks the Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) and uses this to
     * dynamically partition blocks into LIR (low inter-reference recency) and
     * HIR (high inter-reference recency). The basic idea is to keep the LIR
     * blocks in the cache. The total size of the LIRS cache is the sum of the
     * LIR blocks (which are always resident) and the HIR blocks (some of which
     * are resident).
     * <p>
     * LIRS should be much more friendly to garbage collectors since frequently
     * used blocks are essentially pinned while blocks which have been recently
     * visited can be evicted quickly (this will tend to keep HIR blocks in the
     * Eden heap on a JVM).
     * 
     * <h2>Implementation</h2>
     * 
     * LIRS maintains an LRU "stack" (a double linked list named <code>S</code>)
     * and an additional stack of resident HIR blocks (another double linked
     * list named <code>Q</code>). The {@link DLNLirs} nodes contains two
     * additional metadata items : whether the block is LIR or HIR and whether
     * or not the block is resident. When the block is not resident, the
     * {@link DLNLru#v} is cleared to <code>null</code> to release the memory
     * associated with the block.
     * <p>
     * There are two twists to this (specific) implementation.
     * <ol>
     * <li>The "blocks" are variable sized byte[]s and manage the cache size in
     * terms of bytes buffered in memory and this imposes the constraint on the
     * #of LIR and resident HIR blocks.</li>
     * <li>An {@link ILRUCache} "miss" does not read through in terms of the
     * API. Instead, the {@link ILRUCache} will report a "miss" (return
     * <code>null</code>) and the cache miss case will be recognized by the
     * application. The application will read through to the backing database
     * and then do a "putIfAbsent()" with the record read from the database.
     * putIfAbsent() will replace the <code>null</code> {@link DLNLirs#v}
     * reference on the {@link DLNLirs} object with the caller's value.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The three cases described by the journal article in section
     * <code>3.3</code> are handled by {@link #touchEntry(DLNLirs)}. In
     * addition, there is a fourth case when there is no entry in the map for
     * the block which is handled by {@link #addEntry(DLNLirs)}.
     * <p>
     * Note: Unlike the journal paper, we will be batching evictions when the
     * total memory is over capacity, therefore we DO NOT recycle blocks from
     * the HIR list on a cache miss. See
     * {@link BCHMGlobalLRU2#purgeEntriesIfOverCapacity()}.
     * <dl>
     * 
     * <dt>1. Upon accessing a LIR block X (cache hit)</dt>
     * 
     * <dd>LIR blocks are (by definition) resident in the cache. The block is
     * moved to the top of the LRU stack (S) (the MRU position). In addition, if
     * the LIR block was originally on the bottom of the stack (the LRU
     * position) then any HIR nodes on the bottom of the stack are {link
     * #pruneStack() pruned}. See {@link #touchEntry(DLNLirs)}</dd>
     * 
     * <dt>2. Upon accessing a HIR resident block X (cache hit)</dt>
     * 
     * <dd>Move the entry to the top of the LRU stack (S) (the MRU position).
     * There are two cases for block X.
     * <ol>
     * <li>If X is in the LRU stack (S), then we change is status to LIR and
     * remove the block from HIR list (Q). The LIR block on the bottom (LRU
     * position) of (S) is moved to (Q) and its status is changed to HIR. Since
     * we have potentially uncovered a non-LIR block on the bottom of (S), we
     * now {@link #pruneStack() prune} (S).</li>
     * 
     * <li>If X is not in the LRU stack (S), we leave its status as HIR and move
     * it to the end of the HIR stack (Q) (the MRU position). (Note that we have
     * already moved X to the top of the LRU stack (S).)</li>
     * </ol>
     * See {@link #touchEntry(DLNLirs)}</dd>
     * 
     * <dt>3. Upon accessing a HIR non-resident block X (cache miss)</dt>
     * 
     * <dd>Note: The LIRS algorithm calls for us "remove the HIR resident block
     * at the front of list Q (it becomes a non-resident block) and replace it
     * out of the cache". Because we are not managing a fixed pool of fixed size
     * buffers we DO NOT take this step. Instead, a node entry is added to the
     * top of the LRU stack (S) (the MRU position). <br/>
     * See {@link #addEntry(DLNLirs)}</dd>
     * 
     * <dt>4. Upon accessing a block X not in the cache (cache miss)</dt>
     * 
     * <dd>This cases handles a miss when the entry is not in the cache map.
     * Since we batch evictions only when the cache is over the
     * maximumByteInMemory, this case is handled exactly like (3).<br/>
     * See {@link #addEntry(DLNLirs)}</dd>
