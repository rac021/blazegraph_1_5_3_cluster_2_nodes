/**
 * Factory for per-{@link IRawStore} caches backed by a global LRU allowing
 * competition for buffer space across all requests for decompressed records,
 * including B+Tree {@link INodeData} and {@link ILeafData} objects.
 * <p>
 * The vast majority of all data in the stores are B+Tree {@link INodeData} and
 * {@link ILeafData} records. This factory provides per-{@link IRawStore} cache
 * instances which can dramatically reduce read IO for B+Trees, and thus for the
 * entire database. This also serves as the "leafCache" for the
 * {@link IndexSegment}, which uses linked-leaf navigation for
 * {@link ITupleIterator} and {@link ITupleCursor}s and does not otherwise
 * buffer leaves when performing key range scans (versus top-down navigation).
 * <p>
 * There is one cache per store. All cache instances are backed by a
 * <em>shared</em> Least Recently Used (LRU) policy. Entries will be evicted
 * from the appropriate cache as they fall of the end of the LRU. A global LRU
 * ensures that all cache instances compete for the same memory resources.
 * <p>
 * Each per-store cache provides a canonicalizing mapping from the {@link Long}
 * address of a record to a {@link WeakReference} value. The referent of the
 * {@link WeakReference} may be an {@link IDataRecord}, {@link INodeData},
 * {@link ILeafData}, or other object whose persistent state was coded by (or
 * serialized by) the record having that address.
 * <p>
 * Note: The individual cache instances for each {@link IRawStore} reclaim JVM
 * heap space as the {@link WeakReference} values are cleared. The set of such
 * instances is also a {@link ConcurrentWeakValueCache} with a backing LRU so we
 * can hold onto the canonicalizing mappings for closed stores which might be
 * reopened.
 * <p>
 * Note: The global LRU may have impact on GC of the old generation since there
 * will be a tendency of the backing byte[]s to be held long enough to become
 * tenured. Newer incremental garbage collections are designed to address this
 * problem.
 * <p>
 * Note: While caching compressed records would have a smaller memory footprint,
 * this class provides for caching decompressed records since high-level data
 * structures (such as the B+Trees) do not retain references to the compressed
 * data records. Therefore a compressed data record cache based on weak
 * reference semantics for the compressed {@link ByteBuffer}s would be of little
 * utility.

 *       as can allow native long hash map implementations.
