autojar provides a means of filtering a jar file to include only those
resources actually used by the application.  It is used, as recommended,
to reduce the size of the fastutil dependency down to just those class
files actually used by bigdata.  autojar itself is not required to run
bigdata and is NOT bundled with bigdata distributions.
