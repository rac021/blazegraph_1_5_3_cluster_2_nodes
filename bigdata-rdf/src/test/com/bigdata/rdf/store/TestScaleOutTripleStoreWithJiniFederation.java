/**
 * Proxy test suite for {@link ScaleOutTripleStore} running against an
 * distributed federation using Jini services.
 * <p>
 * Note: The tests in this suite setup a bigdata federation for each test. The
 * various data services for the federation all run in the same process, but the
 * data services register themselves and are discovered using jini and
 * communications with those data services use remote procedure calls (at least
 * logically since some JVMs may optimize away the RPC to a local endpoint).
 * <p>
 * Jini MUST be running.
 * <p>
 * You MUST specify at least the following properties to the JVM and have access
 * to the resources in <code>src/resources/config</code>.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *         -Djava.security.policy=policy.all
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note: You will sometimes see a connection refused exception thrown while
 * trying to register the scale-out indices. This happens when some data
 * services were abruptly terminated and those services have not yet been
 * de-registered from jini. A little wait or a restart of Jini fixes this
 * problem.
 * <p>
 * Note: All configuration of the services and the client are performed using
 * the files in <code>src/resources/config/standalone</code>. The
 * <code>.config</code> files have the jini aspect of the client and services
 * configurations. The <code>.property</code> files have the bigdata aspect of
 * the client and services configurations.
 * <p>
 * Note: Normally the services are destroyed after each test, which has the
 * effect of removing all files create by each service. Therefore tests normally
 * start from a clean slate. If you have test setup problems, such as "metadata
 * index exists", first verify that the <code>standalone</code> directory in
 * which the federation is created has been properly cleaned. If files have been
 * left over due to an improper cleanup by a prior test run then you can see
 * such startup problems.
 * 
 * @todo consider reusing a single federation for all unit tests in order to
 *       reduce the setup time for the tests. this would have the consequence
 *       that we are not guarenteed a clean slate when we connect to the
 *       federation. we would need to use dropIndex.
 * 
 * @todo the jini service browser log contains exceptions - presumably because
 *       we have not setup a codebase, e.g., using an embedded class server,
 *       such that it is unable to resolve the various bigdata classes.
 * 
 * @todo could the {@link ServicesManagerServer}
