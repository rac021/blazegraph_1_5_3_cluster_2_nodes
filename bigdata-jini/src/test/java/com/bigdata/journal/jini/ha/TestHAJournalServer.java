    /**
     * This test is used to characterize what happens when we interrupt an RMI.
     * Most methods on the {@link HAGlue} interface are synchronous - they block
     * while some behavior is executed. This is even true for some methods that
     * return a {@link Future} in order to avoid overhead associated with the
     * export of a proxy and DGC thread leaks (since fixed in River).
     * <p>
     * This unit test setups up a service and then issues an RMI that invokes a
     * {@link Thread#sleep(long)} method on the service. The thread that issues
     * the RMI is then interrupted during the sleep.
     * <p>
     * Note: The EXPECTED behavior is that the remote task is NOT interrupted!
     * See these comments from the dev@river.apache.org mailing list:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * Hi Bryan:
     * 
     * I would expect the remote task to complete and return, despite the caller being interrupted.  The JERI subsystem (I�m guessing the invocation layer, but it might be the transport layer) might log an exception when it tried to return, but there was nobody on the calling end.
     * 
     * That�s consistent with a worst-case failure, where the caller drops off the network.  How is the called service supposed to know what happened to the caller?
     * 
     * In the case of a typical short operation, I wouldn�t see that as a big issue, as the wasted computational effort on the service side won�t be consequential.
     * 
     * In the case of a long-running operation where it becomes more likely that the caller wants to stop or cancel an operation (in addition to the possibility of having it interrupted), I�d try to break it into a series of operations (chunks), or setup an ongoing notification or update protocol.  You probably want to do that anyway, because clients probably would like to see interim updates while a long operation is in process.
     * 
     * Unfortunately, I don�t think these kinds of things can be reasonably handled in a communication layer - the application almost always needs to be involved in the resolution of a problem when we have a service-oriented system.
     * 
     * Cheers,
     * 
     * Greg.

     * Hi Bryan,
     * 
     * A number of years ago Ann Wollrath (the inventor of RMI) wrote some example code
     * related to RMI call cancellation; providing both a JRMP and a JERI
     * configuration.
     * Although the example is old and hasn't been maintained, it may provide
     * the sort of
     * guidance and patterns you're looking for.
     * 
     * You can find the source code and related collateral at the following link:
     * 
     * <https://java.net/projects/bodega/sources/svn/show/trunk/src/archive/starterkit-examples/src/com/sun/jini/example/cancellation?rev-219>
     * 
     * I hope this helps,
     * Brian
     * </pre>
     * <pre>
     * This is one of the places where a lease could help. An extension of the
     * existing JERI details could add a lease into the dispatcher layer so that
     * a constant �I am here� message would come through to the service. If the
     * client thread is interrupted it would no longer be pinging/notifying of
     * it�s interest in the results. That would allow the service end, to take
     * appropriate actions. I think that I�d want the export operation or
     * exporter creation, to include the setup of a call back that would occur
     * when an client wants something to stop. I would make the API include a
     * �correlation-ID�, and I�d have that passed into the call to do work, and
     * passed into the call back for cancellation.
     * 
     * Gregg
