/**
 * Test suite for ephemeral znode semantics of children. The basic questions
 * deal with how to maintain order an uniqueness for the ephemeral znodes
 * created for an application process using a {@link ZooKeeper} connection. Note
 * that the {@link ZooKeeper} connection object and its ephemeral znodes are
 * intimately linked. When the {@link ZooKeeper} connection is lost, all
 * ephemeral znodes for that connection are destroyed.
 * <p>
 * Children are inherently unordered in zookeeper. In order to have an order
 * over the children, the {@link CreateMode#EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL} mode must be
 * used. This test suite answers the question whether a {@link ZooKeeper}
 * connection can have more than one direct child for the same znode with (a)
 * the {@link CreateMode#EPHEMERAL} mode; and/or (b) the
 * {@link CreateMode#EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL} mode.
