 * Each {@link ServiceConfiguration} znode defines the service type, the target
 * #of service instances, the replication count, etc for a service. The children
 * of the configuration node are the logicalService instances and use
 * {@link CreateMode#PERSISTENT_SEQUENTIAL}.
 * <p>
 * The children of a logicalService are "election" and "physicalServices". The
 * <code>election</code> znode is a lock node that is used for master election
 * and determining the failover chain for services which support failover. The
 * children of the <code>physicalServices</code> {@link CreateMode#EPHEMERAL}
 * znodes representing the physical service instances. Since they are ephemeral,
 * zookeeper will remove them if the physical service dies.
 * <p>
 * Note: The bigdata services DO NOT use the SEQUENTIAL flag since they need to
 * be able to restart with the save physical service znode. Instead, they create
 * the physicalService znode using the {@link ServiceID} assigned by jini. Since
 * the physical services are NOT sequentially generated, we maintain a
 * {@link ZLock} for the logical service. Physical services contend for that
 * lock and whichever one holds the lock is the primary. The order of the
 * services in the lock queue is the failover order for the secondaries.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ServiceConfigurationZNodeMonitorTask} is run for the each discovered
 * {@link ServiceConfiguration} znode and maintains watches on the dominated
 * logical services znodes and physical service znodes. This allows it to
 * observe changes in the target serviceCount for a given service type and the
 * target replicationCount for a logical service of that type. If the #of
 * logical services is under the target count, then we need to create a new
 * logical service instance (just a znode) and set a watch on it (@todo anyone
 * can create the new logical service since it only involves assigning a UUID,
 * but we need an election or a lock to decide who actually does it so that we
 * don't get a flood of logical services created. All watchers need to set a
 * watch on the new logical service once it is created.) [note: we need the
 * logical / physical distinction for services such as jini which are peers even
 * before we introduce replication for bigdata services.]
 * 
 * The {@link ServicesManagerServer} also sets a {@link Watcher} for each
 * logical service of any service type. This allows it to observe the join and
 * leave of physical service instances. If it observes that a logical service is
 * under the target replication count (which either be read from the
 * configuration node which is the parent of that logical service or must be
 * copied onto the logical service when it is created) AND the host satisifies
 * the {@link IServiceConstraint}s, then it joins a priority election of
 * ephemeral nodes (@todo where) and waits for up to a timeout for N peers to
 * join. The winner of the election is the {@link ServicesManagerServer} on the
 * host best suited to start the new service instance and it starts an instance
 * of the service on the host where it is running. (@todo after the new service
 * starts, the logical service node will gain a new child (in the last
 * position). that will trigger the watch. if the logical service is still under
 * the target, then the process will repeat.)
 * 
 * @todo Replicated bigdata services are created under a parent having an
 *       instance number assigned by zookeeper. The parent corresponds to a
 *       logical service. It is assigned a UUID for compatibility with the
 *       existing APIs (which do not really support replication). The children
 *       of the logical service node are the znodes for the physical instances
 *       of that logical service.
 * 
 * Each physical service instance has a service UUID, which is assigned by jini
 * sometime after it starts and then recorded in the zookeeper znode for that
 * physical service instance.
 * 
 * The physical service instances use an election to determine which of them is
 * the primary, which are the secondaries, and the order for replicating data to
 * the secondaries.
 * 
 * The services create an EPHERMERAL znode when they (re)start. That znode
 * contains the service UUID and is deleted automatically by zookeeper when the
 * service's {@link ZooKeeper} client is closed. The services with persistent
 * state DO NOT use the SEQUENTIAL flag since the same znode MUST be re-created
 * if the service is restarted. Also, since the znodes are EPHEMERAL, no
 * children are allowed. Therefore all behavior performed by the services occurs
 * in queues, elections and other high-level data control structures using
 * znodes elsewhere in zookeeper.
