     * seen by watching the logical service's children) or destroyed (this event
     * is seen by watching the physical service znode).
     * <p>
     * The events that we MUST NOT miss are changes to the ServiceConfiguration

     * <p>
     * We require that this task holds a {@link ZLock} in order to watch the
     * hierarchy. While it should be the only one making structure changes to
     * the logicalServices, physical services which may come and go at any time
     * since they create their own ephemeral znodes.
