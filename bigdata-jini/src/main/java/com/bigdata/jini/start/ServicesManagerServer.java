/**
 * A class for bootstrapping a {@link JiniFederation} across a cluster based on
 * a {@link Configuration} file describing some basic configuration parameters
 * and dynamically managing service configurations. The service configurations
 * are stored in zookeeper and each activated service registers both a
 * persistent znode (for restart) and a variety of transient znodes (to register
 * its claim as an instance of a logical service, for master elections, etc).
 * <p>
 * Each host in a cluster runs <em>ONE (1)</em> of this server. The server
 * will start other services on the local host. Those decisions are based on
 * configuration requirements stored in zookeeper, including the target #of
 * logical services of some service type, the replication count for a logical
 * service, and {@link IServiceConstraint} that are used to decide which host
 * will start the new service.
 * <p>
 * Services are broken down by service type (aka class), by logical service
 * instance, and by physical instances of a logical service. Physical service
 * instances may be transient or persistent. The configuration state required to
 * re-start a persistent physical service is stored in a persistent znode
 * representing that service. For transient services, that znode is ephemeral.
 * <p>
 * The initial configuration for the federation given in a {@link Configuration}
 * file. That file is best located on a shared volume or volume image replicated
 * on the hosts in the cluster, along with the various dependencies required to
 * start and run the federation (java, jini, bigdata, log4j configuration,
 * related JARs, etc). The information in the {@link Configuration} is used to
 * discover and/or start jini and zookeeper instance(s). The
 * {@link ServicesManagerServer} maintains a watch on the
 * {@link ServiceConfiguration} znodes for the various kinds of services and
 * will start or stop services as the state of those nodes changes.
 * 
 * <h2>Service Monitoring</h2>
 * 
 * The {@link ServicesManagerServer} maintains watches on znodes representing
 * {@link ServiceConfiguration}s, logical services, physical service instances,
 * etc. If the number of logical services instances for some service type falls
 * below the {@link ServiceConfiguration#serviceCount} then a new logical
 * service will be created. Likewise, if the number of physical service
 * instances for some logical service falls below the
 * {@link ServiceConfiguration#replicationCount} then a new physical service
 * instance will be started.
 * <p>
 * Physical services which are persistent are represented by persistent znodes
 * within the {@link BigdataZooDefs#PHYSICAL_SERVICES_CONTAINER} for a logical
 * service. This means that the #of physical service instances is NOT decreased
 * when persistent physical service dies or is shutdown normally but ONLY when
 * the physical service instance is destroyed (along with its persistent state).
 * If a persistent physical service instance has died and can not be restarted,
 * then you MUST delete its znode in the
 * {@link BigdataZooDefs#PHYSICAL_SERVICES_CONTAINER} before a new physical
 * service will be created for the corresponding logical service.
 * <p>
 * Physical services which are transient are represented by ephemeral znodes. As
 * soon as one dies and zookeeper notices that its client has timed out the
 * ephemeral znode will be deleted and a watch triggered which will result in a
 * new instance being created on some machine running a
 * {@link ServicesManagerServer} joined with the federation.
 * <p>
 * Most bigdata services have persistent state and may be safely shutdown and
 * restarted. To shutdown a bigdata service instance use
 * {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin#shutdown()} or zap it from the command line (not
 * the preferred approach, but that will only take the service down, but not
 * destroy its data).
 * 
 * <h2>Startup</h2>
 * 
 * Zookeeper service and jini instances are handled somewhat specially. Each is
 * a self-contained system and provides its own means for peers to discover each
 * other and for clients to discover the peers. The remainder of the services
 * use jini to perform service discovery and zookeeper to register ephemeral
 * znodes which represent their existence as part of a logical service and allow
 * them to contend in the master election for a logical service. Only those
 * services listed in the {@link ServicesManagerConfiguration} will be
 * considered for start.
 * 
 * <h3>Zookeeper startup</h3>
 * 
 * A zookeeper service instance will be started if one was identified in the
 * {@link Configuration} as running on this host in the
 * {@link ZookeeperServerConfiguration} and none is found to be running at that
 * time.
 * 
 * <h3>Jini startup</h3>
 * 
 * A jini server instance will be considered for start if one is specified for
 * this host in the {@link JiniCoreServicesConfiguration} using a
 * {@link LookupLocator} or if you are using multicast. In addition, the
 * {@link IServiceConstraint}s for the jini server in the {@link Configuration}
 * must be satisified by this host.
 * 
 * <h3>Configuration push</h3>
 * 
 * During startup, the {@link ServiceConfiguration}s will be pushed to
 * zookeeper. This will trigger a variety of watches on the znodes for the
 * service configurations both in this instance and in other
 * {@link ServicesManagerServer}s running on other hosts which are part of the
 * same federation.
 * <p>
 * Since the {@link ServiceConfiguration}s are pushed each time a
 * {@link ServicesManagerServer} is started it is CRITICAL that all
 * {@link ServicesManagerServer}s use the same configuration. The
 * {@link Configuration} may either be a file on a shared volume or a URL.
 * 
 * <h3>Persistent service restart</h3>
 * 
 * Once we are connected to both jini and zookeeper a scan will be performed of
 * the persistent physical services registered in zookeeper. For each such
 * service, if the service was started on this host and can not be discovered
 * using jini, then an attempt will be made to restart the service. We don't
 * want to do this on an ongoing basis because it would cause any service that
 * was deliberately shutdown to be restarted as soon as we discover that it is
 * no longer discoverable.
 * 
 * <h2>Service replication and failover</h2>
 * 
 * Jini and zookeeper each have their own failover models.
 * 
 * <h3>Jini</h3>
 * 
 * You can run a number of jini peers and any client can connect to any
 * registrar. This is all transparent. You can even start a new jini instance
 * after all have died. Services which have already been discovered will remain
 * reachable (assuming that a network path exists) for some time after the last
 * jini registrar has died.
 * 
 * <h3>Zookeeper</h3>
 * 
 * Zookeeper uses a quorum model. You always want to provision an odd number of
 * zookeeper instances. ONE (1) instance gives you no failover (but the instance
 * may be restarted if it dies). THREE (3) instances give you ONE (1) failure.
 * 
 * <h3>Persistent bigdata services</h3>
 * 
 * <strong>Replication and service failover have NOT been implemented for
 * bigdata</strong>
 * <p>
 * When the physical service supports failover, the shutdown of a physical
 * service instance does not take the logical service offline if there are
 * remaining physical services instances for that logical service. However, the
 * loss of all physical instances of a logical service will result in the loss
 * of the persistent state for the logical service as a whole.
 * <p>
 * The two main services which require failover are the
 * {@link ITransactionService} and the {@link IDataService} (which includes the
 * {@link IMetadataService} as a special case). The loss of the
 * {@link ILoadBalancerService} is normally not critical as only history about
 * the system load over time is lost.
 * 
 * <h4>Transaction service</h4>
 * 
 * tdb
 * 
 * <h4>(Meta)data services</h4>
 * 
 * The basic design is for {@link IDataService} is to pipeline state changes
 * from a master through a failover chain of secondaries. Write can proceed
 * asynchronously on the pipeline until the next commit, at which point the
 * secondaries must be synched with the master. Since all instances have the
 * same state for any commit point, you can read from any instance but you
 * always write on the master.
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous overflow operations are carried out by the master (could be a
 * secondary, but that raises the complexity of the operation) and the generated
 * {@link IndexSegment}s are replicated to the secondaries before atomic
 * updates which redefined index views.
 * 
 * <h2>Destroying services</h2>
 * 
 * <strong>Destroying an arbitrary service instance is dangerous - if it is not
 * replicated then you can loose all your data!</strong>.
 * <p>
 * To <strong>destroy</strong> a bigdata service usie
 * {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin#destroy()}.
 * 
 * <h2>Federation shutdown sequence</h2>
 * 
 * See {@link JiniFederation#distributedFederationShutdown(boolean)}
 * 
 * <h2>Shutdown</h2>
 * 
 * Normal shutdown will kill child processes, using their normal shutdown
 * whenever possible. Once the child processes are dead, the server will
 * terminate as well. Use {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin#shutdown()} and
 * {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin#shutdownNow()} for normal shutdown.
 * 
 * <h2>Signal handling</h2>
 * 
 * <dl>
 * 
 * <dt>HUP</dt>
 * 
 * <dd>This executes the same logic that is describe above for startup.
 * However, it will re-read the {@link Configuration} from whatever source was
 * specified when the server was started. This signal may be used to update the
 * zookeeper configuration, to restart any stopped persistent services, etc.
 * <p>
 * See {@link ServicesManagerStartupTask}.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>TERM</dt>
 * 
 * <dd>All child processes are terminated, using normal shutdown whenever
 * possible. Once the child processes are dead, the server will terminate as
 * well. (This is normal shutdown.)</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>KILL</dt>
 * 
 * <dd>This signal is NOT trapped. The server will terminate immediately. Any
 * child processes will continue to execute (this is the behavior on at least
 * Windows and linux platforms).</dd>
 * 
 * </dl>
 * 
 * Please note that Java has limited support for signal handlers, so these
 * behaviors might not be available on your deployment platform. When in doubt,
 * TEST FIRST!
 * 
 * @todo document dependencies for performance counter reporting and supported
 *       platforms. perhaps config options for which counters are collected and
 *       which are reported to the LBS.
 * 
 * @todo It is possible to create locks and queues using javaspaces in a manner
 *       similar to zookeeper. Java spaces supports a concept similar to a watch
 *       and supports transactions over operations on the space. Gigaspaces has
 *       defined a variety of extensions that provide FIFO queues.
 * 
 * @todo The {@link MetadataService}, the {@link ILoadBalancerService}, and
 *       the {@link ITransactionService} MUST NOT have more than one logical
 *       instance in a federation. They can (eventually) have failover
 *       instances, but not peers. The {@link DataService} is the only one that
 *       already supports multiple logical service instances (lots!) (but not
 *       failover).
 * 
 * @todo Operator alerts should be generated when persistent physical services
 *       die (this can be noticed either via jini or when the ephemeral znode
 *       for the master election queue goes away).
 * 
 * FIXME remaining big issues are destroying logical and physical services (not
 * implemented yet) and providing failover for the various bigdata services (not
 * implemented yet).
