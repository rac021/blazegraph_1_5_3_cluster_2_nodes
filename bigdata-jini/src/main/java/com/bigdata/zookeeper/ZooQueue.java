/**
 * Producer-consumer queue.
 * 
 * <h3>Queue pattern</h3>
 * 
 * This is a summary of the queue pattern. This pattern is encapsulated by the
 * API, but it is here for your reference anyway.
 * <p>
 * The children in the queue are created using the SEQUENTIAL flag. The data for
 * each child is the value specified to {@link #add(Serializable)}.
 * <p>
 * (A) The consumer read the children, setting a watch. If there are no more
 * children in the queue, then the consumer will be notified when the watch is
 * triggered. When the watch is triggered, the children are again read from the
 * queue.
 * <p>
 * (B) If there are children, the consumer sorts them into lexical order, and
 * proceeds in the sorted order (FIFO queue). As children are processed
 * successfully, they are deleted from the queue. Goto (A).
 * <p>
 * If the producers wishes to block when the queue is full it must read the
 * capacity of the queue (stored as an {@link Integer} in the znode of the queue
 * itself). It reads the children, setting a watch as a side effect. If the #of
 * children exceeds the capacity of the queue, then the producer blocks until
 * the watch is triggered and, on inspection, there are fewer children in the
 * queue than its capacity.
 * <p>
 * If there is a single producer, then it can destroy queue whenever it likes
 * simply by deleting any children remaining in the queue and then deleting the
 * queue. If there are multiple producers, then a sibling of the queue znode
 * must be create which marks the queue as invalid and producers must look for
 * that mark (just like {@link ZLock}).
