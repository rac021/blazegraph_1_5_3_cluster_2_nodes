/**
 * This class accepts a dynamic set of watch criteria and pump events into a
 * queue when any watch was triggered. Hooks are defined that you can use to
 * identify new watch criteria based on {@link WatchedEvent}s. By default, this
 * will extend a watch over the transitive closure of the children of some
 * znode. However, you can limit the set of watch criteria using some hook
 * methods. For example, only following certain children for a given path.
 * <p>
 * {@link WatchedEvent}s are received in the zookeeper event thread. In order to
 * minimize the work performed in that thread, events are triaged. The triage
 * determines the "type" of the znode for which the event was received. Types
 * reflect application considerations. For example, a change in the #of children
 * of a logical service versus a change in the data for a service configuration.
 * If the typed event adds or removes children that are of interest (by default,
 * all children are of interest, but you may place restrictions on that), then
 * new watch criteria are added for the newly identified children. The typed
 * event is then placed on an unbounded {@link BlockingQueue}. The application
 * is responsible for draining the queue. The constructor establishes the
 * initial watch on the root of the hierarchy of interest and then returns
 * control to the application. All other work by this class happens in the
 * zookeeper event thread.
 * <p>
 * Zookeeper DOES NOT provide a guarantee that we will see all events of
 * interest since state changes may occur after a watch has been triggered and
 * before the {@link WatchedEvent} is received and before we have the chance to
 * reset the watch. By queuing events we reduce the time in the zookeeper event
 * thread and thus increase responsiveness and reduce the opportunity for missed
 * events, but we DO NOT guarantee that the application will see all events.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo This re-establishes the watcher when the event is handled in the
 *       zookeeper thread. That is probably not a good idea as it increases the
 *       demand on the zookeeper thread. Instead, when the application sees the
 *       wrapped event it should read the data, re-establishing the watch as a
 *       side-effect, and then issue whatever actions are necessary based on the
 *       delta between the historical state of the znode/children and their
 *       current state. This pattern guarantees that no state changes are
 *       missed, but requires the application to track the old state of each
 *       znode/children of interest.
