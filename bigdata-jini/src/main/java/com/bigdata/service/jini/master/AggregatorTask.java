/**
 * A task which aggregates writes destined for a specific scale-out index. An
 * instance of this class may be submitted to any {@link IRemoteExecutor} and
 * used to concentrate the writes from multiple clients. The requirement for an
 * aggregation task grows in proportion to the #of index partitions.
 * <p>
 * The task creates a {@link BlockingBuffer} (the input queue) and an
 * {@link IndexWriteTask} which will write on the specified scale-out index. It
 * then exports a proxy for the input queue. Each client which attaches to this
 * {@link AggregatorTask} must allocate a local {@link BlockingBuffer} and
 * assign a worker task to drain chunks from that buffer and transfer them to
 * this task via the exposed proxy.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The generic type of the procedure used to write on the index.
 * @param <O>
 *            The generic type for unserialized value objects.
 * @param <R>
 *            The type of the result from applying the index procedure to a
 *            single {@link Split} of data.
 * @param <A>
 *            The type of the aggregated result.
 * 
 * @todo The aggregator's input buffer should be closed by the
 *       {@link TaskMaster} for a given (name,timestamp) when the task is done.
 *       
 * @todo It should be transparent to use aggregators in combination with the
 *       asynchronous write API. This may require the introduction another level
 *       of indirection.
 *       <p>
 *       For example, the RDF parser task directly creates the asynchronous
 *       write buffers today. However, it should accept a factory which it then
 *       applies to obtain those buffers. When using an aggregator, the factory
 *       needs to return the proxy for the write buffer for the corresponding
 *       aggregator. If this is to happen dynamically, then the
 *       {@link TaskMaster} {@link ServiceMap} must be dynamic as well (which
 *       could introduce load balancing for the {@link IRemoteExecutor} s). When
 *       an (RDF parser) task needs an asynchronous write buffer, it must
 *       atomically start an aggregator if none exists for the given
 *       (name,timestamp). The responsibility for starting that aggregator needs
 *       to be either centralized or de-centralized with global synchronous
 *       locking.
 *       <p>
 *       This all sounds far too complex. If the task declares the indices on
 *       which it will write then we can do this statically when the
 *       {@link TaskMaster} starts. The clients receive the {@link UUID}s of the
 *       services on which the aggregator(s) are running. They can then lookup
 *       the appropriate aggregator on each such service in parallel, collecting
 *       the set of aggregators for each index on which they will write. This is
 *       similar to the session mechanism of the {@link DataService} which is
 *       used to support distributed joins. See {@link JoinMasterTask},
 *       {@link JoinTaskFactoryTask} and {@link Session}.
 * 
 * @todo For scale-out indices with an exceedingly large #of index partitions it
 *       may be necessary to take additional steps to limit the RAM burden of
 *       the aggregator. For example, either the aggregator can buffer the
 *       writes on local disk or the the clients could split their writes across
 *       a population of aggregators each of which takes on a key-range for the
 *       index (the key-ranges would be more coarse than those of the index
 *       partitions themselves).
