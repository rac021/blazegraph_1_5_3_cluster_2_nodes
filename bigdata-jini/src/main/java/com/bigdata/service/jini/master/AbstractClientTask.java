/**
 * An abstract base class which may be used for client tasks run by the master
 * on one or more data services. This class contends for a {@link ZLock} based
 * on the assigned {@link #clientNum} and then invoked {@link #runWithZLock()}
 * if the {@link ZLock} if granted. If the lock is lost, it will continue to
 * contend for the lock and then run until finished.
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation presumes that {@link #runWithZLock()} has some
 * means of understanding when it is done and can restart its work from where it
 * left off. One way to handle that is to write the state of the client into the
 * client's znode and to update that from time to time as the client makes
 * progress on its task. You can invoke {@link #setupClientState()} to do that.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class DOES NOT have to be submitted to an {@link IDataService} for
 * execution. Most client tasks will in fact run on {@link IClientService}s
 * rather than {@link IDataService}s. This class extends
 * {@link DataServiceCallable} for the convienence of subclasses which MAY
 * introduce a requirement to execute on an {@link IDataService}.
