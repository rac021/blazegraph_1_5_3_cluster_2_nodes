/**
 * <p>
 * Abstract base class for configurable services discoverable using JINI. The
 * recommended way to start a server is using the {@link ServiceStarter}.
 * However, they may also be started from the command line using main(String[]).
 * You must specify a policy file granting sufficient permissions for the server
 * to start.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * java -Djava.security.policy=policy.all ....
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You must specify the JVM property
 * <code>-Dcom.sun.jini.jeri.tcp.useNIO=true</code> to enable NIO.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Other command line options MAY be recommended depending on the JVM and the
 * service that you are starting, e.g., <code>-server</code>.
 * <p>
 * The service may be <em>terminated</em> by terminating the server process.
 * Termination implies that the server stops execution but that it MAY be
 * restarted. A {@link Runtime#addShutdownHook(Thread) shutdown hook} is
 * installed by the server so that you can also stop the server using ^C
 * (Windows) and <code>kill</code> <i>pid</i> (Un*x). You can record the PID of
 * the process running the server when you start it under Un*x using a shell
 * script. Note that if you are starting multiple services at once with the
 * {@link ServiceStarter} then these methods (^C or kill <i>pid</i>) will take
 * down all servers running in the same VM.
 * <p>
 * Services may be <em>destroyed</em> using {@link DestroyAdmin}, e.g., through
 * the Jini service browser. Note that all persistent data associated with that
 * service is also destroyed!
 * 
 * @see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6380355, which
 *      describes a bug in the service browser that will display a
 *      "NullPointerException" dialog box if you destroy a service which
 *      implements {@link DestroyAdmin} but not {@link JoinAdmin}.
 * 
 * @see http 
 *      ://java.sun.com/products/jini/2.0/doc/api/com/sun/jini/start/ServiceStarter
 *      .html for documentation on how to use the ServiceStarter.
 * 
 * @todo delete the lock file, config file, etc. and the service directory if
 *       the service is destroyed.
 * 
 * @todo document exit status codes and unify their use in this and derived
 *       classes.
 * 
 * @todo add {@link StatusType} and link its values to the running state of the
 *       service.
 * 
 * @todo add {@link ServiceType} with suitable pretty icons.
