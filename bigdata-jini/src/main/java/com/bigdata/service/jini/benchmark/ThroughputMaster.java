/**
 * Utility class for benchmarking index operations on a federation. This test
 * harness can be parameterized for at least the following:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>general purpose scale-out index performance tests</dt>
 * <dd>These tests should focus on bulk index read, write, range count, and
 * key-range scan operations. general purpose scale-out indices do not constrain
 * the choice of separator keys for index partitions so any given read or write
 * MAY be split across one or more index partitions. The workload can be shaped
 * by the #of clients, by the relative proportion of reads and writes (including
 * inserts, updates, and deletes), by the distribution of the center and spread
 * of each read and write operation, the key type, the value type, and by the
 * frequency and key range of range count and key range scan operations.</dt>
 * <dt> sparse row store performance tests</dt>
 * <dd>These tests should excercise atomic row read, atomic row write, and
 * atomic row scans. by design the sparse row store restricts any given logical
 * row to a single index partition so each row read and row write operation will
 * be directed to ONE index partition. The row scan is atomic for each row read,
 * and may read multiple rows atomically. The workload can be shaped by the #of
 * clients, the degree of scatter of the primary keys for the logical row, the
 * #of non-null columns in each row, the #of distinct timestamped values for
 * each column, the key type, the value types, the mixture of reads and writes
 * (including inserts, updates, and deletes) (probably 90/10), and the frequency
 * and range of row scans. It is sufficient to test with a single schema (aka
 * column family) since that is realized as a simple prefix on the primary key.
 * validation should ensure that row reads and row writes are never split across
 * index partition boundaries. That can be done by a read on the metadata index
 * in which we examine the separator keys or by asserts in the code for read,
 * write and scan. It is the responsibility of the {@link ISimpleSplitHandler}
 * to ensure that separator keys are chosen for index partitions that fall on
 * logical row boundaries.</dd>
 * <dt> bigdata file system performance tests</dt>
 * <dd>These tests should exercise block append, read, and update and stream
 * oriented read and write. the workload can be shaped by the #of clients, by
 * the #of and distribution of files read and written, by the #of blocks in a
 * file, etc.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * These tests share several common features:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Operations are independent</li>
 * <li>Operations are UNISOLATED</li>
 * </ol>
 * Operations are local for the sparse row store and the bigdata file system,
 * and MAY or MAY NOT be local for generalized scale-out indices depending on
 * the workload. To the extent that the operations are independent and local the
 * system should scale linearly. Applications that concentrate operations on a
 * few key ranges will create hot spots for those key ranges which may or may
 * not translate into bottlenecks. Likewise, cache may be defeated to the extent
 * that operations rarely revisit recently visited parts of the key space.
 * <p>
 * Higher-level applications (such as the RDF DB) can introduce dependencies in
 * the scale-out indices. For example, a write on the RDF DB must first write on
 * TERM2ID, then on ID2TERM, and finally may write on the SPO, POS, and OSP
 * indices in parallel.
 * <p>
 * You can examine the performance on the system at several levels:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Operating System</dt>
 * <dd>The {@link AbstractFederation} collects performance counters from the
 * underlying operating system using <code>vmstat</code> or the equivalent and
 * relays them to the {@link LoadBalancerService}. This is done (by default)
 * for all machines participating in a federation, including those running
 * clients.</dd>
 * <dt>Client</dt>
 * <dd>The {@link AbstractFederation} collects statistics on its work queues,
 * including the moving average of the queue length and the moving average of
 * the queueing time. This information is collected for all clients (including
 * the {@link DataService}s) and is relayed to the {@link LoadBalancerService}.
 * This mechanism may be extended by an application to report additional
 * performance counters. Clients MAY also report their own {@link Event}s.</dd>
 * <dt>Data services</dt>
 * <dd>The {@link DataServer}s collects statistics on its internal work
 * queues, including the moving average of the various queue lengths and the
 * moving average of the queueing time for those queues. The most interesting
 * queue is generally the "write service", which is where tasks which will write
 * on an index are queued. The {@link DataServer} also reports a variety of
 * {@link Event}s to the {@link LoadBalancerService}, most of which deal with
 * synchronous and asynchronous overflow handling.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * The {@link LoadBalancerService} normally exposes an {@link CounterSetHTTPD}
 * instance which may be used to examine the aggregated performance counters
 * using a navigational model or as correlated timeseries and pivot tables
 * suitable for import into a worksheet program. The {@link CounterSetHTTPD}
 * also exposes an {@link Event} viewer. See {@link XHTMLRenderer}. In
 * addition, any client or service MAY optionally expose a
 * {@link CounterSetHTTPD} instance giving a "live" look at the performance
 * counters for that host and service, but only the current value for each
 * counter will be available (no timeseries). Finally, the
 * {@link LoadBalancerService} logs both the performance counters and the
 * {@link Event}s. The performance counter logs are available for post-mortem
 * analysis using {@link CounterSetHTTPDServer}. The {@link Event}s are logged
 * in a tab-delimited format and may be imported into a worksheet for further
 * analysis.
 * <p>
 * While bigdata does not report metrics via JMX, you can enable remote JMX and
 * examine JMX counters for JVMs throughout the federation. This can be done
 * trivially if you are running one {@link DataServer} per host since you can
 * pre-assign the port number for remote JMX in the {@link Configuration} file.
